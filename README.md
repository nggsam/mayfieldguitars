## How to run locally

This site is built using [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/).

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed.

### Installation

Install Nikola with extras:

```bash
pip install "Nikola[extras]"
```

### Running the dev server

Navigate to the `mayfieldguitars.com` directory and run:

```bash
cd mayfieldguitars.com
nikola auto
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:8000` that automatically rebuilds when you change files.
